# Starter Project
If you want a bare starter project for Spring cloud, basically you only need to use 3 projects from this repo:

 - [Eureka](https://github.com/timpamungkas/base-microservice/tree/master/eureka)
 - [Zuul](https://github.com/timpamungkas/base-microservice/tree/master/zuul)
 - [Hello](https://github.com/timpamungkas/base-microservice/tree/master/hello) (for rest client template)

Don't forget to adjust library version if you want to.
